# Angular2: My Top 10 Heroes
Heroes Quickstart Tutorial (modified) to display my Top Ten Heroes

##CHANGES I MADE:
 
##*Hero Detail view was modified to include the list of heroes (see snapshot 2)
##*i used observables instead of promise
##*added images and text descriptions for each hero
##*made app sexy (a bit)

##*Things removed:
 - search feature
 - heroes component (ul list of heroes was moved into "app/components/hero/hero-detail.component.ts"
 - add feature
 - delete feature
 
 *if you want to have those original features use this one instead --> https://github.com/leroyvaughan/Angular2_Quickstart-Heroes
